# i3DGS
i3DGS is an interactive platform for the methods of 3D/Polyhedral Graphic Statics. This platform is designed to educate the principles of equilibirum using reciporcal polyhedral diagrams by providing a variety of different examples. The objective of this platform is to encourage students, researchers and parctitioners to use the geometry-based methods of equilibirum in design and engineering problems. The methods of 3D/Polyhedral Graphic statics is developed based on the “principle of the equilibirum of polyhedral frames.”
